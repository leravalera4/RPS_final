# SOL Private Game Flow - Technical Documentation

## Problem We Solved
**Issue**: When creating a private SOL game, 0.012 SOL was deducted immediately (0.01 stake + ~0.002 rent exemption), even if the second player never joined.

## Solution Architecture

### Before (Broken Flow)
1. Player 1 creates private game
2. **IMMEDIATE on-chain transaction** â†’ 0.012 SOL deducted
3. If Player 2 never joins â†’ Player 1 loses 0.012 SOL
4. Player 1 would need to manually cancel and refund

### After (Fixed Flow)
1. Player 1 creates private game â†’ **NO on-chain transaction**
2. Game exists only in backend (off-chain)
3. Player 2 joins â†’ Backend emits `game_started_pre_tx` event
4. **Both players execute on-chain transactions simultaneously**:
   - Player 1: `createGame` transaction
   - Player 2: `joinGame` transaction
5. Backend waits for BOTH transactions to confirm (`onchain_game_created` + `onchain_game_joined`)
6. Only then emits `game_started` event
7. Game begins

### Key Changes

#### Frontend (`web/hooks/use-game.ts`)
```typescript
// Line 635: Skip on-chain creation for private SOL games
if (currency === 'sol' && gameType === 'private') {
  console.log('ðŸ”— Private SOL game - will create on-chain when second player joins')
  // NO anchorCreateGame() call here
}
```

```typescript
// Line 237: Handle game_started_pre_tx event
const handleGameStartedPreTx = async (data: any) => {
  // Set status to 'waiting' to show transaction screen
  setGameState(prev => ({ ...prev, gameStatus: 'waiting' }))
  
  // Execute on-chain transaction
  if (isPlayer1) {
    await anchorCreateGame(gameId, stakeAmount, currency)
    socket.emit('onchain_game_created', { gameId })
  } else if (isPlayer2) {
    await anchorJoinGame(gameId)
    socket.emit('onchain_game_joined', { gameId })
  }
}
```

#### Backend (`backend/src/socket/socketHandlers.js`)
```javascript
// Lines 632-684: Wait for both transactions before starting
if (result.gameState.currency === 'sol' && result.gameState.gameType === 'private') {
  // Emit pre-transaction event
  io.to(gameId).emit('game_started_pre_tx', { gameId, gameState })
  
  // Track completion
  const onchainCompleted = { player1: false, player2: false }
  
  socket.on('onchain_game_created', (data) => {
    onchainCompleted.player1 = true
    checkAndStartGame() // Only starts if both are true
  })
  
  socket.on('onchain_game_joined', (data) => {
    onchainCompleted.player2 = true
    checkAndStartGame() // Only starts if both are true
  })
  
  function checkAndStartGame() {
    if (onchainCompleted.player1 && onchainCompleted.player2) {
      io.to(gameId).emit('game_started', { gameId, gameState })
      startRoundTimer(gameId, io, 30)
    }
  }
}
```

## Rent Exemption (0.002 SOL)

### Why It Exists
- Solana accounts require rent exemption for data storage
- Game PDA needs ~0.002463840 SOL for rent exemption
- This gets returned when the game account is closed

### How We Handle It
1. **During Game**: Rent stays in Game PDA
2. **After Finalization**: `close_game` instruction returns rent to creator (Player 1)
3. **On Cancel**: `cancel_game` instruction returns rent + stake to creator

### Anchor Program (`anchor/programs/rps-game/src/lib.rs`)
```rust
// Lines 501-532: Cancel game and refund SOL
pub fn cancel_game(ctx: Context<CancelGame>, _game_id: String) -> Result<()> {
    // Transfer SOL back from game account to player
    let stake_amount = game.stake_amount;
    **ctx.accounts.user.lamports.borrow_mut() += stake_amount;
    **ctx.accounts.game.to_account_info().lamports.borrow_mut() -= stake_amount;
    
    // Close account returns rent to creator automatically
    Ok(())
}
```

## Benefits

1. **No SOL Lost**: If Player 2 never joins, Player 1 loses nothing
2. **Atomic Transactions**: Both players stake simultaneously
3. **Fair Start**: Game only begins when both are ready
4. **Rent Returned**: Creator gets rent exemption back after game ends
5. **Cancel Support**: Creator can cancel and refund before game starts

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Player 2 Never Joins
1. Player 1 creates private SOL game
2. Check: Player 1 balance unchanged
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Check: Player 1 can safely leave without loss

### Test Case 2: Both Join
1. Player 1 creates private SOL game
2. Player 2 joins by link
3. Check: Both see transaction modals
4. Check: Game starts only after both confirm
5. Check: Both SOL deducted correctly

### Test Case 3: Player 1 Cancels Before Player 2 Joins
1. Player 1 creates private SOL game
2. Player 1 clicks "Leave Game"
3. Check: `cancel_game` called (if implemented)
4. Check: Player 1 gets full refund (including rent)

## Summary

**Key Achievement**: We prevented 0.002 SOL rent exemption from being deducted when creating a private game. By deferring on-chain game creation until both players are ready, we ensure that:

- No SOL is lost if a player doesn't join
- Both players stake atomically
- Rent exemption is returned after game completion
- Fair and safe gameplay for all participants
